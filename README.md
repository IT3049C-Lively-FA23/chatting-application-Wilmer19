## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: 
I deserve a 19/20 because all of my tests passed expect one. 
I'm not sure why the last test says "skipped". I didn't know this could happen. I always thought I test could
either pass or fail. I double checked the instructions and my code is working fine.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
I really enjoyed this assignment because I learned how to make a chatting application. It was really
helpful having the emojis help guide me. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
One hour 

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
It's used to create a large heading for the element.
