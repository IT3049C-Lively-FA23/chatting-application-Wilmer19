## Self-Evaluation:

how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 
I deserve a 12/10 because my user's name is saved to local storage and user's name is retrieved from local storage on page load. 
I also attempted the extra credit. I created a "switch color mode" button that switches the body text from white to black. I tried
to change the rest of the app to black but I was having trouble with the css styling.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- Write your self-reflection under this line -->
This assignment was challenging because there wasn't an example to look at. I tried my best to use the lecture videos to 
help guide me and figure out the homework. I also went to the IT learning center for more help. The TA was really helpful and 
I got a better understanding.

### How long it took me to finish this?
Two hours

## Discussion Questions:
1. What does the bootstrap `display-4` class do?
It's used to create a large heading for the element.
